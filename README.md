# Stock_Market_Prediction-SMA-EMA
Stock Market Prediction Using SMA and EMA:  In this project or analysis, the focus is on predicting stock market trends using two popular technical indicators - Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA). 
These indicators are widely used in the field of technical analysis to identify potential entry and exit points for trades based on historical price data.
The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of a specified number of past closing prices. It helps smooth out short-term price fluctuations, providing a clearer picture of the overall trend. SMA crossovers and divergences can be used to signal potential buying or selling opportunities.
